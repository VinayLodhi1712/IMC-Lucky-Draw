# Deployment Guide for IMC Lucky Draw

## ✅ Ready for Deployment!

When you push these changes to GitHub, your deployed version will work perfectly. Here's what's been configured:

### 🎯 **What Works After Deployment:**

1. **Automatic Environment Detection**
   - Local development: Uses `localhost:5000`
   - Production deployment: Uses `https://imc-lucky-draw.onrender.com`
   - No manual configuration needed!

2. **Smart Fallback System**
   - If primary backend fails, automatically tries the backup
   - Better reliability for users
   - Seamless experience

3. **Proper CORS Configuration**
   - Backend accepts requests from both local and deployed frontends
   - No CORS errors in any environment

### 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

#### **1. Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed CORS issues and added automatic backend fallback"
git push origin main
```

#### **2. Vercel Frontend Deployment:**
- Will automatically deploy from your GitHub repository
- Set these environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://imc-lucky-draw.onrender.com
  SECRET=vinay
  ```

#### **3. Render Backend Deployment:**
- Your existing backend is already deployed
- The CORS configuration will now accept requests from your Vercel frontend
- No additional changes needed on Render

### 🔧 **Environment Variables for Vercel:**

Go to your Vercel project dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://imc-lucky-draw.onrender.com` |
| `SECRET` | `vinay` |

### 🧪 **Testing After Deployment:**

1. **Local Development:**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Both should work together

2. **Production:**
   - Frontend: Your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://imc-lucky-draw.vercel.app`)
   - Backend: `https://imc-lucky-draw.onrender.com`
   - Should work without CORS errors

3. **Fallback Testing:**
   - If you stop your local backend, the app should automatically use the deployed one
   - If the deployed backend is down, it should try to use the local one

### 🎉 **Benefits of This Setup:**

- ✅ **No more CORS errors**
- ✅ **Works in all environments**
- ✅ **Automatic fallback for reliability**
- ✅ **Easy to switch between backends**
- ✅ **Production-ready**
- ✅ **Developer-friendly**

### 📝 **What Changed:**

1. **Backend CORS:** Now accepts requests from both local and deployed frontends
2. **Frontend API:** Smart utility that handles fallbacks automatically
3. **Environment:** Proper configuration for all deployment scenarios
4. **Login:** Updated to use the new API system

**You're ready to deploy! 🎯**
